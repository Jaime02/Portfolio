        <p>I am a Computer Engineering graduate at the Public University of Navarra (UPNA). I started in 2020 during the pandemic apocalypse and I finished the degee in 2024. I developed the <Link className="styled-a" href="/projects/paint-filter-manager">Paint filter manager</Link> project in my thesis.</p>

        <p>Briefly, the degree was not a easy process and required some effort, sweat and tears. In the end, it has allowed me to have excellent experiences, so I guess it was worth it.</p>
