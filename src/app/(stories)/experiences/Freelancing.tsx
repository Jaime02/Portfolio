          in 2021. It was a great way of learn by doing doing projects and getting paid at same time. I worked with different clients and even small companies. First, I joined{" "}

            Fiverr

          After working for <span className="font-bold italic">many, many</span> hours, I have earned about 2500 euros in total (but don&apos;t tell tax authorities üòú)

        <p>Upwork is a freelancing platform that connects businesses with freelancers. It offers more control over the contract and payment process than Fiverr.</p>

          I worked there from 2022 to 2024. However, <span className="font-bold">a client scammed me 700 euros</span>. I had a terrible experience with the upwork costumer support, they finally did
          not belive me and even blocked my account!
